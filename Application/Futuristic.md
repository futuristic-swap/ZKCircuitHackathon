### Hackathon Overview

This project is inspired by Curve finance. We are building a safe and convenient stablecoin DEX on Findora chain:

- Benefit by the Findora wallet, we already got high privacy and security to our assets.

- Enjoy the high APY low risk stablecoin investments on Findora!

### Project Details

- The exchange contract is deployed on Findora Testnet: `0x....`.

- The UI is implemented by the web-based Web3 technologies. Users require to install a Wallet extension such as Metamask in their browser to support all the features.
